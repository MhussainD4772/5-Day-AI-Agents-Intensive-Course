We're seeing a shift from AI as a tool to AI as a fundamental engine driving innovation in bringing new medicines to patients.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned: **De Novo Drug Design (Generating Novel Molecules)**. This is a particularly exciting area because it represents a paradigm shift from simply screening existing compounds to actively creating new ones.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into \"De Novo Drug Design\" and its advancements:\n\n**What is De Novo Drug Design?**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved:\n1.  **Target Identification:** Finding a biological molecule (like a protein) involved in a disease.\n2.  **High-Throughput Screening (HTS):** Testing millions of existing chemical compounds against the target to see if any bind and have an effect.\n3.  **Lead Optimization:** Modifying promising \"hit\" compounds to improve their efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties.\n\n**De novo design (literally meaning \"from the beginning\") aims to use AI to design entirely *new* molecular structures from scratch that are optimized to interact with a specific biological target and possess desired drug-like properties.** It bypasses the need to rely solely on pre-existing chemical libraries.\n\n**How AI Powers De Novo Design:**\n\nAI, particularly **generative models**, is the key enabler. These models are trained on massive datasets of known molecules and their properties. They learn the underlying \"rules\" of chemistry and molecular structure-property relationships. Once trained, they can be used to:\n\n1.  **Generate Novel Molecular Structures:**\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** VAEs can learn a compressed \"latent space\" representation of molecules. By sampling points from this latent space and decoding them, they can generate new, valid molecular structures.\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** GANs involve two neural networks: a generator that creates molecules and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real and generated molecules. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic and relevant molecules.\n    *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / Transformers:** These models are often used with chemical representations like SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings to generate new sequences that translate into novel molecular structures.\n\n2.  **Optimize for Multiple Properties Simultaneously:**\n    *   This is where AI truly shines. Instead of just generating *any* molecule, generative models can be conditioned to generate molecules that are predicted to have:\n        *   **High binding affinity** to the target protein.\n        *   **Good ADMET properties** (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) – meaning they are likely to be absorbed by the body, reach their target, be metabolized safely, and not be overly toxic.\n        *   **Favorable synthesizability** (i.e., chemically feasible to create in a lab).\n        *   **Novelty** (to avoid patent issues and explore new chemical space).\n\n**Why is this a Significant Development?**\n\n*   **Exploring Untapped Chemical Space:** Traditional screening is limited by the diversity of existing compound libraries. AI can explore vast, novel regions of chemical space, potentially uncovering drugs that would never have been found otherwise.\n*   **Faster Design Cycles:** AI can generate and evaluate millions of hypothetical molecules in a fraction of the time it would take to synthesize and test them experimentally.\n*   **Designing for \"Undruggable\" Targets:** For targets that have proven difficult to hit with existing drug molecules, de novo design offers a way to create bespoke molecules specifically tailored to their unique binding pockets.\n*   **Personalized Medicine Potential:** In the future, de novo design could potentially be used to design drugs optimized for specific patient populations or even individual genetic profiles.\n\n**Examples of Companies and Approaches:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for using generative AI to design novel molecules for various therapeutic areas, including fibrosis and oncology. They have multiple AI-designed drugs in clinical trials.\n*   **Exscientia:** Uses AI for target identification, hit identification, and lead optimization, including designing novel molecules.\n*   **Atomwise:** Employs deep learning for structure-based drug design, predicting how small molecules will bind to proteins. While not strictly \"de novo\" generation in all cases, their models can screen and design novel interactions.\n*   **Relay Therapeutics:** Focuses on understanding protein motion and using that knowledge to design novel therapeutics, often leveraging AI and computational chemistry.\n\n**The \"Generative AI\" Angle:**\n\nThe recent surge in interest around **Generative AI** (like the models behind ChatGPT) has directly impacted de novo drug design. These large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating complex sequences. When applied to chemical representations (like SMILES strings), they can learn the grammar of chemistry and generate novel, valid molecular structures with unprecedented sophistication.\n\nIn essence, de novo drug design is about using AI to become the architect of new medicines, rather than just a scavenger for existing ones. It's a powerful leap forward with the potential to dramatically speed up and diversify the drug discovery pipeline.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the main companies involved in **De Novo Drug Design**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
